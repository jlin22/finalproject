 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 The project is chess. 
 Two players will be able to play against each other in chess. 
 There will also be an AI for players against in chess.
 
 USER INTERFACE
 The first menu will be choosing what to do.
 Examples include playing a game against another player, playing a game against AI,
 loading a previous game, and playing from a saved game state
 The chess game is terminal based.
 The board will be displayed in terminal, and commands will be inserted in the terminal to make moves.
 If we have time, we will use external libraries to display the game in a a different format.
 
 TECHNICAL DESIGN
 
 TOPICS COVERED
 We will be using networking to connect and send data between two computers.
 We will be working with files by writing and reading data about individual chess matches
 We will be using processes(mainly exec) to run commands in terminal through the C program
 We will potentially be using pipes for a client and server
 The client will take in the commands, while the server will display the chess board
 We will potentially be using signals to kill programs once the user wants to exit
 We will potentially be using shared memory to access the chess board between separate programs (Unsure about this)
 
 PROJECT BREAKDOWN
 Michael - Responsible for the chess board, chess AI, and shared memory(if it is even used)
 John - Responsible for the visuals, writing and reading game states, creating a server and client through pipes, signals,
 and setting up the network between two computers to allow them to play against each other
 The visuals include a initial menu that is displayed, and then taking the user into the options that they choose
 such as playing a new multiplayer game, playing a new AI game, reading an old game state, and exiting the program
 
 DATA STRUCTURES
 We will use a 2D array to represent the chess board (and potentially a matrix)
 We will use trees for the minimax algorithm that the AI will use to make a move
 
 ALGORITHMS USED
 Minimax for the AI (most basic)
 Alpha beta pruning for advancing the AI
